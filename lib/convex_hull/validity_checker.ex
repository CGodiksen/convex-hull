  Module providing functions to check the validity of the input to the convex hull algorithms. This module contains general
  validity checks that are relevant for all algorithms, this includes checking if enough points were given to construct a
  convex hull, checking if all points have the same dimensions and checking if the points have a valid amount of dimensions.
