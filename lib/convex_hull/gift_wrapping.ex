  Also known as Jarvis' march after R. A. Jarvis who published it in 1973. Simple but not the most efficient algoritm.
  The algorithm has a time complixity of O(nh), where n is the number of points and h is the number of points on the convex hull.
  This algorithm can be used when n is small or when h is expected to be very small with respect to n.
